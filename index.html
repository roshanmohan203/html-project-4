                <h2>Russia Announces Destruction Of Ukraine's Last Operational Warship</h2>
                <p>Blackwater is collected in blackwater collecting units via a ring-main system. The ring-main system is divided by various decks or zones onboard and connected to different blackwater collecting units.

                    There can be multiple numbers of collecting units (4-10 units) depending upon the size of the ship. They are usually installed in technical spaces throughout the ship, where technical staff can monitor and maintain them.
                    
                    The blackwater is collected in the collecting tanks by gravity or vacuum. In the case of a vacuum system, the vacuum is generated in the collecting tank & its suction line using attached vacuum pumps which operate per the vacuum level through sensors.
                    
                    The blackwater goes to the collecting units through coarse strainers, which must be cleaned daily or as per demand. These strainers remove any large-sized solids that may go to the collecting tanks, clog pipework or the discharge pumps.
